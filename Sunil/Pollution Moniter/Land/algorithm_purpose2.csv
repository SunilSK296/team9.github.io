Algorithm,Purpose
Bellman-Ford,Detect sudden spikes in pollution or soil toxicity across subzones
Priority Queue (Max Heap),Prioritize subzones for immediate waste collection based on land quality and pollution
Dijkstra,Compute shortest path for waste collection vehicle between subzones to minimize travel
Land Quality Computation,Calculate overall land quality of subzone from pollution, soil toxicity, and heavy metal levels
