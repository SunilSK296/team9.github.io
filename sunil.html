    <!-- TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SECTION -->
    <section id="traffic-management" class="project-section">
      <h2><b>1. TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT</b></h2>

      <h3><b>Concept: Interconnected Smart Traffic Signal Network</b></h3>
      <p>
      In our designed city, all traffic signals are connected to each other through a central communication network. Every signal constantly shares data about:
      <br>• Current traffic density
      <br>• Queue length of vehicles
      <br>• Number of vehicles arriving from each direction
      <br>• Presence of emergency vehicles
      <br>• Abnormal conditions (accidents, roadblocks, VIP movement, etc.)
      <br>Using this shared real-time data, each signal creates a local plan but also adjusts it to match nearby signals, avoiding congestion moving from one junction to another.
      </p>

      <h2><b>How the system works:</b></h2>

      <h3><b>1. Real-Time Data Sharing Between Signals</b></h3>
      <p>
      • Each traffic signal has sensors or AI cameras.<br>
      • Every 2–5 seconds, each signal sends data to nearby signals.<br>
      • The communication network forms a graph, where:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Signals = Nodes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Roads = Edges<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;c. Edge weights = congestion level / travel time<br>
      This enables situation awareness across the city.
      </p>

        <img src="img/1_1.png" width="400" height="400">
      </div>

      <h3><b>2. Predicting Traffic Build-Up & Adjusting Green Time</b></h3>
      <p>
      Each signal uses the data from surrounding intersections to calculate:<br>
      • Which lane will get congested next<br>
      • How long the current vehicles must wait<br>
      • How long the green signal should be continued<br>
      • Whether the signal should be extended or reduced<br><br>
      <b>Algorithms Used Here</b><br>
      Used to prioritize lanes:<br>
      • Quick Sort / Merge Sort — Sorts directions by highest vehicle density → highest gets priority.<br>
      • Heap Sort — Maintains a priority queue:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Emergency vehicles → highest priority<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Congested lanes → next priority<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Low-density lanes → lowest<br>
      This ensures optimal order of green signals.
      </p>
      <div class="center-img">
        <img src="img/1_2.png" width="400" height="400">
      </div>

      <h3><b>3. Cooperative Decision-Making Between Signals</b></h3>
      <p>
      Each signal predicts how its decision affects the next signal.<br>
      Example:<br>
      If Signal A releases 100 vehicles, Signal B increases its green time to prepare for incoming flow.<br>
      This avoids:<br>
      • Traffic pile-up at the next junction<br>
      • Sudden congestion spikes<br>
      • Unbalanced flow<br><br>
      <b>Graph Algorithms Here</b><br>
      • BFS / DFS → To check if any path is blocked and traffic needs rerouting<br>
      • Dijkstra’s Algorithm → Predict travel time between signals<br>
      • Bellman-Ford → Adjust decisions when sudden congestion appears<br>
      • Floyd-Warshall → City-wide congestion prediction
      </p>

      <h3><b>4. Emergency Vehicle Priority System</b></h3>
      <p>
      When an ambulance, fire truck, or police vehicle is detected:<br>
      <b>Step-by-step Algorithm Flow</b><br>
      1. Signal detects emergency vehicle through RFID/GPS.<br>
      2. Immediately sends alert to all nearby signals.<br>
      3. Graph is updated → weights reduced on the emergency route.<br>
      4. Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the fastest route to the hospital.<br>
      5. The route signals turn green in advance (Green Corridor).<br>
      6. All other lanes get temporary red, sorted using a priority queue.<br>
      This ensures uninterrupted, fast movement for emergency services.

    <!-- SMART CITY POLLUTION MONITORING -->
<section id="pollution-monitoring" class="project-section" style="max-width:980px;margin:24px auto;padding:18px;background:#ffffff;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(20,20,30,0.06)">
  <h2><b>2. SMART CITY POLLUTION MONITORING</b></h2>

  <p>
    <h3><b>Concept: Interconnected Environmental Monitoring Network</b></h3><br>
    In our smart city, pollution monitoring is designed as an interconnected system that continuously observes
    environmental conditions across different zones. Sensors installed throughout the city collect real-time data
    and share it with nearby zones and a central control system. This enables early detection, prediction, and
    coordinated control of pollution.
  </p>

  <!-- AIR POLLUTION -->
  <p>
    <h3><b>2.1 Air Pollution Monitoring</b></h3><br>
    The air pollution monitoring system focuses on detecting, analyzing, and predicting air quality variations
    across the city. Each zone is equipped with sensors that measure pollutants and environmental factors, allowing
    the system to understand how pollution spreads and affects neighboring areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Data Collected:</b><br>
    • PM2.5 and PM10 concentration<br>
    • CO and other harmful gases<br>
    • Wind speed and wind direction<br>
    • Temperature and humidity<br>
    • Pollution spike indicators (threshold-based)<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3><b>1. Real-Time Air Quality Data Sharing Between Zones</b></h3><br>
    • Each zone sends sensor data every few seconds to nearby zones.<br>
    • The city is modeled as a graph where:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Zones = Nodes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Airflow paths = Edges<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;c. Edge weights = pollution transfer intensity<br>
    This structure helps understand how pollution in one zone influences others.

      </div>

  <p>
    <h3><b>2. Air Quality Evaluation & Zone Prioritization</b></h3><br>
    • AQI (Air Quality Index) is calculated for every zone.<br>
    • Zones are sorted based on severity using sorting algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithms Used:</b><br>
    • Quick Sort / Merge Sort — Sort zones by AQI value.<br>
    • Heap / Priority Queue —<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Highly polluted zones → highest priority<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Moderate zones → medium priority<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Clean zones → lowest priority<br>
  </p>

      </div>

  <p>
    <h3><b>3. Pollution Spread Prediction Across Zones</b></h3><br>
    Pollution does not remain confined to one zone. Wind direction and airflow cause it to spread.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Graph Algorithms Used:</b><br>
    • DFS (Depth First Search) — Tracks deep and long-range pollution spread paths.<br>
    • BFS (Breadth First Search) — Identifies immediate neighboring zones at risk.<br>
    This allows early warnings and preventive actions.
  </p>

      </div>

  <p>
    <h3><b>4. Sudden Pollution Spike Detection</b></h3><br>
    Sudden spikes in pollution may occur due to accidents, fires, industrial releases, or traffic surges.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithm Used:</b><br>
    • Bellman–Ford Algorithm — Detects abnormal AQI increases across zones and flags dangerous regions.
  </p>

      </div>

  <p>
    <h3><b>5. Pollution-Aware Routing & Decision Support</b></h3><br>
    Once dangerous zones are detected, safe routing decisions are made.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithm Used:</b><br>
    • Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm — Finds least-polluted paths while avoiding high-risk zones.
