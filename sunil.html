    <!-- TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SECTION -->
    <section id="traffic-management" class="project-section">
      <h2><b>1. TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT</b></h2>

      <h3><b>Concept: Interconnected Smart Traffic Signal Network</b></h3>
      <p>
      In our designed city, all traffic signals are connected to each other through a central communication network. Every signal constantly shares data about:
      <br>• Current traffic density
      <br>• Queue length of vehicles
      <br>• Number of vehicles arriving from each direction
      <br>• Presence of emergency vehicles
      <br>• Abnormal conditions (accidents, roadblocks, VIP movement, etc.)
      <br>Using this shared real-time data, each signal creates a local plan but also adjusts it to match nearby signals, avoiding congestion moving from one junction to another.
      </p>

      <h2><b>How the system works:</b></h2>

      <h3><b>1. Real-Time Data Sharing Between Signals</b></h3>
      <p>
      • Each traffic signal has sensors or AI cameras.<br>
      • Every 2–5 seconds, each signal sends data to nearby signals.<br>
      • The communication network forms a graph, where:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Signals = Nodes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Roads = Edges<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;c. Edge weights = congestion level / travel time<br>
      This enables situation awareness across the city.
      </p>
      <div class="center-img">
        <img src="img/1_1.png" width="400" height="400">
      </div>

      <h3><b>2. Predicting Traffic Build-Up & Adjusting Green Time</b></h3>
      <p>
      Each signal uses the data from surrounding intersections to calculate:<br>
      • Which lane will get congested next<br>
      • How long the current vehicles must wait<br>
      • How long the green signal should be continued<br>
      • Whether the signal should be extended or reduced<br><br>
      <b>Algorithms Used Here</b><br>
      Used to prioritize lanes:<br>
      • Quick Sort — Sorts directions by highest vehicle density → highest gets priority.<br>
      Maintains a priority queue:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Emergency vehicles → highest priority<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Congested lanes → next priority<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;o Low-density lanes → lowest<br>
      This ensures optimal order of green signals.
      </p>
      <div class="center-img">
        <img src="img/1_2.png" width="400" height="400">
      </div>

      <h3><b>3. Cooperative Decision-Making Between Signals</b></h3>
      <p>
      Each signal predicts how its decision affects the next signal.<br>
      Example:<br>
      If Signal A releases 100 vehicles, Signal B increases its green time to prepare for incoming flow.<br>
      This avoids:<br>
      • Traffic pile-up at the next junction<br>
      • Sudden congestion spikes<br>
      • Unbalanced flow<br><br>
      <b>Graph Algorithms Here</b><br>
      • Dijkstra’s Algorithm → Predict travel time between signals<br>
      • Traffic optimizer function manages the traffic flow.
      </p>

      <h3><b>4. Emergency Vehicle Priority System</b></h3>
      <p>
      When an ambulance, fire truck, or police vehicle is detected:<br>
      <b>Step-by-step Algorithm Flow</b><br>
      1. Signal detects emergency vehicle through RFID/GPS.<br>
      2. Immediately sends alert to all nearby signals.<br>
      3. Graph is updated → weights reduced on the emergency route.<br>
      4. Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the fastest route to the hospital.<br>
      5. The route signals turn green in advance (Green Corridor).<br>
      6. All other lanes get temporary red, sorted using a priority queue.<br>
      This ensures uninterrupted, fast movement for emergency services.

    <!-- SMART CITY POLLUTION MONITORING -->
<section id="pollution-monitoring" class="project-section" style="max-width:980px;margin:24px auto;padding:18px;background:#ffffff;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(20,20,30,0.06)">
  <h2><b>2. SMART CITY POLLUTION MONITORING</b></h2>

  <p>
    <h3><b>Concept: Interconnected Environmental Monitoring Network</b></h3><br>
    In our smart city, pollution monitoring is designed as an interconnected system that continuously observes
    environmental conditions across different zones. Sensors installed throughout the city collect real-time data
    and share it with nearby zones and a central control system. This enables early detection, prediction, and
    coordinated control of pollution.
  </p>

  <!-- AIR POLLUTION -->
  <p>
    <h2><b>2.1 Air Pollution Monitoring</b></h2><br>
    The air pollution monitoring system focuses on detecting, analyzing, and predicting air quality variations
    across the city. Each zone is equipped with sensors that measure pollutants and environmental factors, allowing
    the system to understand how pollution spreads and affects neighboring areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Data Collected:</b><br>
    • PM2.5 and PM10 concentration<br>
    • CO and other harmful gases<br>
    • Wind speed and wind direction<br>
    • Temperature and humidity<br>
    • Pollution spike indicators (threshold-based)<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3><b>1. Real-Time Air Quality Data Sharing Between Zones</b></h3><br>
    • Each zone sends sensor data every few seconds to nearby zones.<br>
    • The city is modeled as a graph where:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Zones = Nodes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;b. Airflow paths = Edges<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;c. Edge weights = pollution transfer intensity<br>
    This structure helps understand how pollution in one zone influences others.

      </div>

  <p>
    <h3><b>2. Air Quality Evaluation & Zone Prioritization</b></h3><br>
    • AQI (Air Quality Index) is calculated for every zone.<br>
    AQI CALCULATION MODEL<br>
    Formula used: AQI=((PM2.5×3)+(PM10×2)+(CO×4))/9<br>	​
    • Zones are sorted based on severity using sorting algorithms.
    <div>
      <h4>AQI Anomaly Levels</h4>
  <table class="aqi-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>AQI Range</th>
        <th>Anomaly Level</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>AQI &lt; 100</td>
        <td>0 (Normal)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>100 ≤ AQI &lt; 180</td>
        <td>1 (Moderate)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AQI ≥ 180</td>
        <td>2 (Severe Spike)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithms Used:</b><br>
    • Quick Sort — Sort zones by AQI value.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Highly polluted zones → highest priority<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Moderate zones → medium priority<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;o Clean zones → lowest priority<br>

  <p>
    <h3><b>3. Pollution Spread Prediction Across Zones</b></h3><br>
    Pollution does not remain confined to one zone. Wind direction and airflow cause it to spread.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Graph Algorithms Used:</b><br>
    • DFS (Depth First Search) — Tracks deep and long-range pollution spread paths.<br>
    • BFS (Breadth First Search) — Identifies immediate neighboring zones at risk.<br>
    This allows early warnings and preventive actions.

  <p>
    <h3><b>4. Sudden Pollution Spike Detection</b></h3><br>
    Sudden spikes in pollution may occur due to accidents, fires, industrial releases, or traffic surges.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithm Used:</b><br>
    • Bellman–Ford Algorithm — Detects abnormal AQI increases across zones and flags dangerous regions.

  <p>
    <h3><b>5. Pollution-Aware Routing & Decision Support</b></h3><br>
    Once dangerous zones are detected, safe routing decisions are made.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Algorithm Used:</b><br>
    • Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm — Finds least-polluted paths while avoiding high-risk zones.

  <!-- WATER POLLUTION -->
  <h2><b>Concept:Water Pollution Monitoring System</b></h2>
  <p>
    Water is a critical natural resource used for drinking, agriculture, fishing, industry, and power generation.
    However, rapid industrialization, untreated drainage, climate change, and sudden rainfall events lead to:
    <br>• Water pollution
    <br>• Flood risks near dams and rivers
    <br>• Ecological imbalance
    <br>• Threats to human life and aquatic species
    <br><br>
    This project proposes a Smart Water Pollution and Flood Monitoring System that continuously monitors
    water quality and water level across different river zones connected to a dam and takes real-time
    decisions using algorithms.
  </p>

  <h3><b>How the system works:</b></h3>

  <h3><b>1. Real-World Zonal Classification</b></h3>
  <p>
    The river–dam system is divided into four main zones, each further divided into 5 subzones for accuracy:
    <br><br>
    • <b>Upstream Zone</b> — Natural water inflow from rainfall, hills, and tributaries<br>
    • <b>Dam Zone</b> — Primary water collection area (drinking & domestic use)<br>
    • <b>Downstream Zone 1</b> — Agriculture, fishing, non-drinking usage<br>
    • <b>Downstream Zone 2</b> — Industrial discharge and treated drainage release
  </p>
  <div class="center-img">
    <img src="img/2_1.png" width="400" height="400">
  </div>

  <h3><b>2. Subzone-Based Monitoring Concept</b></h3>
  <p>
    Each zone is divided into 5 subzones to:
    <br>• Capture localized pollution
    <br>• Detect sudden changes early
    <br>• Reduce error due to single sensor failure
    <br><br>
    <b>Why subzones?</b><br>
    • Sudden spikes may occur in only one part of a zone<br>
    • Enables precise alerts and responses<br>
    • Supports graph-based algorithms like Bellman–Ford
  </p>
  <div class="center-img">
    <img src="img/2_2.png" width="400" height="400">
  </div>

  <h3><b>3. Real-Time Data Collection & Storage</b></h3>
  <p>
    Each subzone is equipped with sensors that collect:
    <br>• Water Level (%)<br>
    • Pollution Index (TDS, chemicals, biological waste)<br>
    • Time-based readings<br><br>
    All sensor data from all zones and subzones is stored in a single CSV file,
    representing real-time environmental conditions and allowing easy integration
    with IoT systems.
  </p>

  <h3><b>4. Sudden Spike & Flood Detection</b></h3>
  <p>
    <b>Bellman–Ford Algorithm</b> is used to detect sudden spikes in water level or pollution
    across upstream subzones.
    <br><br>
    <b>Why Bellman–Ford?</b><br>
    • Handles sudden rises or drops in readings<br>
    • Detects abnormal spike patterns<br>
    • Suitable for multi-subzone dependency analysis
    <br><br>
    <b>Flood Detection Logic:</b><br>
    If 3 or more upstream subzones exceed the safe water level threshold,
    a FLOOD ALERT is generated.
  </p>
  <div class="center-img">
    <img src="img/2_3.png" width="400" height="400">
  </div>

  <h3><b>5. Dam Water Management Strategy</b></h3>
  <p>
    Based on pollution levels at the dam zone:
    <br>• Low pollution → Store water<br>
    • Moderate pollution → Partial water release<br>
    • High pollution → Immediate water release<br><br>
    <b>Purpose:</b><br>
    • Maintain clean reservoir water<br>
    • Prevent long-term contamination<br>
    • Ensure drinking water safety
  </p>

  <h3><b>6. Industrial & Drainage Pollution Control</b></h3>
  <p>
    Downstream Zone 2 is continuously monitored for:
    <br>• Chemical discharge<br>
    • Treated sewage overflow<br><br>
    <b>Alert Condition:</b><br>
    If pollution index exceeds the safe threshold, an industrial alert is triggered
    and notifications are sent to industries and pollution control authorities.
  </p>

  <h3><b>7. Fishing Zone Identification</b></h3>
  <p>
    Fishing activities are permitted only in Downstream Zone 1 when:
    <br>• Pollution levels are below the safe limit<br>
    • Oxygen content is sufficient<br><br>
    <b>Decision Logic:</b><br>
    Pollution &lt; threshold → Fishing Allowed<br>
    Pollution ≥ threshold → Fishing Banned
  </p>

  <h3><b>8. Priority-Based Decision Making</b></h3>
  <p>
    A Priority Queue (Max Heap) is used to assign immediate attention to:
    <br>• Zones with high pollution<br>
    • Flood-prone upstream areas<br>
    • Industrial contamination regions<br><br>
    Highest-risk zones are handled first to ensure quick response.

  <h2><b>Concept: Land Pollution Monitoring System</b></h2>
  <p>
    Land is a vital resource for agriculture, habitation, industry, and recreation. However, improper waste management, industrial discharge, chemical spills, and urbanization lead to:
    <br>• Land pollution
    <br>• Soil degradation and loss of fertility
    <br>• Ecological imbalance
    <br>• Threats to human health and crops
    <br>
    This project proposes a <b>Smart Land Pollution and Waste Management System</b> that continuously monitors land quality and pollution across different city zones and takes real-time decisions using algorithms.
  </p>

  <h3><b>How the system works:</b></h3>

  <h3><b>1. Real-World Zonal Classification</b></h3>
  <p>
    The city’s land area is divided into <b>four main zones</b>, each further divided into <b>5 subzones</b> for precision:
    <br>• Residential Zone — Houses, parks, and urban areas
    <br>• Industrial Zone — Factories, workshops, hazardous waste areas
    <br>• Agricultural Zone — Farmland and plantations
    <br>• Landfill / Depot Zone — Central collection point for waste
  </p>

  <h3><b>2. Subzone-Based Monitoring Concept</b></h3>
  <p>
    Each zone contains 5 subzones to:
    <br>• Capture localized pollution and soil degradation
    <br>• Detect sudden changes early
    <br>• Reduce errors due to single sensor failures
    <br><br>
    <b>Why subzones?</b>
    <br>• Pollution or contamination may occur in only part of a zone
    <br>• Enables precise alerts and cleanup scheduling
    <br>• Supports graph-based algorithms like <b>Bellman–Ford</b> for sudden spike detection
  </p>

  <h3><b>3. Real-Time Data Collection & Storage</b></h3>
  <p>
    Each subzone is equipped with sensors that collect:
    <br>• Pollution Level (0–100 scale)
    <br>• Soil Toxicity Index
    <br>• Moisture Content (%)
    <br>• Heavy Metal Index (Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, etc.)
    <br>• Time-based readings
    <br><br>
    All sensor data from all zones and subzones is stored in a <b>single CSV file</b>, representing real-time environmental conditions and allowing easy integration with IoT or city management systems.
  </p>

  <h3><b>4. Land Quality & Priority Computation</b></h3>
  <p>
    <b>Land Quality Score</b> is computed for each subzone:
    <br>
    <code>LandQualityScore = 100 - (0.5*PollutionLevel + 0.3*SoilToxicity + 0.2*HeavyMetalIndex)</code>
    <br>
    Scale: 0–100 (higher = better quality)
    <br>Subzones with <b>LandQualityScore &lt; 50</b> are marked critical
    <br><br>
    <b>Algorithms Used:</b>
    <br>• Bellman–Ford → Detects sudden spikes in pollution or soil toxicity across subzones
    <br>• Max Heap (Priority Queue) → Determines which subzones need immediate cleanup
    <br>• Dijkstra Algorithm → Computes shortest path for waste collection vehicle between subzones
  </p>

  <h3><b>5. Waste Collection Strategy</b></h3>
  <p>
    • Waste collection vehicles start at the <b>Landfill/Depot</b>.
    <br>• <b>Traversal Strategy:</b>
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Select subzone with highest priority from Max Heap
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Move to subzone using shortest path (Dijkstra)
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Mark subzone as visited
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Repeat until all subzones are serviced
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Return to depot
    <br>• Ensures critical zones are serviced first and all subzones are visited efficiently.
  </p>

  <h3><b>6. Alerts & Notifications</b></h3>
  <p>
    • Critical Land Quality: LandQualityScore &lt; 50 → Immediate cleanup alert
    <br>• High Pollution: Pollution Level &gt; threshold → Priority cleanup
    <br>• Industrial Subzones: Hazardous waste detected → Alert authorities
    <br><br>
    Notifications are sent to:
    <br>• Waste management teams
    <br>• Environmental authorities
    <br>• City administration
  </p>

  <h3><b>7. Priority-Based Decision Making</b></h3>
  <p>
    A <b>Priority Queue (Max Heap)</b> assigns immediate attention to:
    <br>• Subzones with high pollution
    <br>• Subzones with low land quality
    <br>• Industrial areas with hazardous waste
    <br><br>
    Highest-risk subzones are handled first to ensure <b>fast and efficient cleanup</b>.
